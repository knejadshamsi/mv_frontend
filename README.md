# MOVE: GeoJSON Data Visualization Platform

## Overview
MOVE is a platform primarily designed to display various types of GeoJSON data, with a focus on Montreal. Originating as a personal project, MOVE aims to expand its reach, allowing anyone to clone the repository for their use. It is particularly tailored for students and academic staff dealing with GeoJSON data.

## Features
Currently, MOVE's core functionality revolves around displaying GeoJSON data. Future updates are planned to enhance these capabilities significantly.
It now supports 3d first person interactive environment with the ability to multi select buildings.

## Technology Stack
MOVE is built using SvelteKit, alongside HTML and CSS. These technologies provide a robust and flexible foundation for the platform.

## Installation
To set up MOVE, follow the typical SvelteKit project setup. No additional dependencies or prerequisites are required beyond the standard SvelteKit installation.

## Running the Project
Once installed, you can run MOVE using the `npm run dev` command. This launches a local development server to view and interact with the platform.

## Usage
Included in the project are sample data sets showcasing public transportation. These samples serve as a starting point for users to understand how MOVE displays GeoJSON data.

## Future Plans
- Integration of a 3D interactive environment. [done]
- Extensive code refactoring for improved performance and scalability. [done]
